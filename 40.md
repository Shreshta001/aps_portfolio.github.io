# 📥 Google Drive Sync Conflict Resolution using Johnson-Trotter Permutations

When multiple users edit Google Docs/Sheets offline, sync conflicts occur. Johnson-Trotter permutation generation allows Google Drive to test **all edit orderings efficiently** with minimal changes.

---

## 🔀 Edit Conflict Model

- **Operations:** User changes during offline mode  
- **Permutations:** All orderings of user edits  
- **Goal:** Merge in most consistent or user-friendly way

---

## 🎯 Objective

To merge conflicting document versions **intelligently and safely**, preserving intent while minimizing confusion or data loss.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

- **Johnson-Trotter Algorithm**  
  Generates permutations with **minimal swaps** — efficient for small edit sets.

| Metric             | Value       | Description                            |
|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n!)`     | Needed to cover all merge orders       |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`      | In-place permutation generation        |
