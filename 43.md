# 🌐 **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm for Maximum Bandwidth Optimization**

The **Edmonds-Karp algorithm** is a classic implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to compute the **maximum flow** in a flow network. In large-scale systems, especially those involving **resource sharing or bandwidth management**, this algorithm plays a vital role.

| Use Case                               | How Edmonds-Karp Helps                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛰️ **Data Center Bandwidth Optimization** | Determines the max data flow between clusters or availability zones with constraints on link capacities. |
| 🔄 **Live Streaming & Google Meet**     | Balances real-time media flow to ensure optimal quality by respecting user device/network limitations.   |
| 📶 **YouTube CDN Traffic Balancing**    | Computes max flow paths to distribute high-volume requests across regional edge servers.                 |
| ☁️ **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**      | Schedules resource allocation where multiple services contend for limited bandwidth or shared I/O.       |
| 🔐 **Security & Access Control**        | Analyzes permission graphs to ensure no overuse of privileged data access beyond defined flow limits.    |

Its strict use of BFS makes it predictable in performance while maintaining optimal flow under network capacity constraints.

## ⚙️ Algorithmic Highlights

| Metric             | Value                  | Explanation                                             |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | O(VE²)                 | Due to BFS on residual graph for each path augmentation |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | O(V + E)               | Stores graph, residual capacities, and parent tracing   |

### Step-by-step overview:
1. Start with 0 flow.
2. While there's a path from source to sink in the residual graph (using BFS):
   - Find the **bottleneck capacity** on that path.
   - **Augment the flow** along the path by that capacity.
   - Update the residual capacities (forward and reverse).
3. Repeat until no augmenting path exists.
