# 🔎 **Best First Search: Navigating Smarter Paths**

Best First Search is like having a smart guide on a journey — it uses **heuristics** (educated guesses) to prioritize the most promising paths first. This approach helps algorithms find efficient routes without blindly exploring every possibility.

At Google, this heuristic-driven pathfinding is fundamental in powering:

- 🗺️ **Google Maps navigation and real-time rerouting**  
- 🤖 **AI decision-making in robotics and self-driving cars**  
- 🔍 **Search result ranking with relevance scoring**

## 📐 Algorithm Insight

Best First Search explores nodes based on heuristic estimates of distance or cost to the goal. It keeps track of nodes to explore using a **priority queue**, always expanding the most promising node next.

| Step                   | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Initialize frontier     | Start with the initial node in a priority queue ordered by heuristic cost |
| Expand nodes           | Remove the best candidate and explore neighbors |
| Update frontier        | Add neighbors with their heuristic scores   |
| Repeat                 | Until the goal is reached or no nodes left   |

| Metric             | Value              | Explanation                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(b^m)`           | `b` = branching factor, `m` = max depth; depends heavily on heuristic quality |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(b^m)`           | Frontier and visited nodes stored in memory                                 |
