# 🌐 **Network Traffic Management Using Min-Cut Max-Flow Algorithm**

Google's backbone — its global **network infrastructure** — spans countless data centers, fiber links, and routing hubs. Ensuring smooth, congestion-free data flow between these points is critical. One of the most powerful tools to manage this is the **Min-Cut Max-Flow** algorithm.

This algorithm helps Google **maximize throughput** and **minimize bottlenecks** in a graph-like model of their network.

## 🕸️ Graph-Based Network Modeling

- **Nodes (Vertices):**  
  Represent routers, switches, or data centers.

- **Edges (Links):**  
  Each connection between nodes has:
  - Bandwidth capacity  
  - Current data flow  
  - Latency or reliability metrics

- **Source to Sink:**  
  The goal is to move as much data from a **source node** (e.g., incoming traffic) to a **sink node** (e.g., destination servers) while respecting bandwidth limits.

## 🧠 Final Objective

Use **Max-Flow algorithms** like Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp to determine:

- 📈 **Maximum data** that can flow through the network  
- 🪓 **Minimum cut** of edges that, if removed, block all flow — identifying bottlenecks and critical infrastructure

This allows **real-time rerouting**, **load balancing**, and **resilience planning**.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

Google’s network optimization tools rely on:

- **Max-Flow algorithms** to compute total possible throughput  
- **Min-Cut** to isolate and analyze weak points or overloaded connections  
- **Augmenting paths** and **residual graphs** to iteratively improve flow

### ✅ Benefits

- Increases reliability of real-time services (e.g., Search, Gmail, Maps)  
- Ensures efficient resource utilization  
- Enables predictive failure detection and load shifting
