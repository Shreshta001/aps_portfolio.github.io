## 📌 Overview

Data security and integrity are paramount for Google’s vast infrastructure. Sometimes, datasets may become partially corrupted or certain values may be "stolen" or tampered with due to malicious activities or transmission errors. The **Stolen Values Problem** focuses on reconstructing the original, untampered dataset as accurately as possible from incomplete or inconsistent data.

## 🧠 Application

Google uses sophisticated **Dynamic Programming (DP)** techniques to reconstruct or estimate the original data. The DP approach minimizes the cumulative difference between reconstructed and observed values, ensuring data integrity and robustness against partial theft or corruption.

| Metric             | Value     | Description                                        |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n)`    | Efficient, linear in number of data points         |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`    | Stores intermediate reconstruction states          |

## 📊 Visual Representation

Envision a timeline of data points, some marked as missing or suspect. The DP algorithm iteratively fills in gaps by balancing consistency and minimizing discrepancies.
