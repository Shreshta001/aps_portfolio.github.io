# 🌐 **Kruskal’s Algorithm for Optimizing Global Fiber Networks**

**Kruskal’s algorithm** is a classic greedy algorithm used to compute the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph. In real-world applications, it’s ideal for optimizing network infrastructure by minimizing total connection costs while ensuring full connectivity.

## ⚙️ Algorithmic Highlights

| Metric             | Value                       | Explanation                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | O(E log E)                  | Sorting edges dominates runtime             |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | O(V)                        | Primarily for union-find data structure     |

### Step-by-step overview:
1. Sort all edges in increasing order of weight.  
2. Initialize each vertex as its own set using Union-Find.  
3. For each edge in sorted list:  
   - If the edge connects two different sets, include it in MST and union the sets.  
4. Repeat until MST has (V - 1) edges.

## 🧠 Fun Fact & Out-of-the-Box Google Applications

- **YouTube Server Optimization:** Kruskal helps reduce connection costs between streaming clusters using minimal-link trees.  
- **Google Earth High-Res Syncing:** Selects minimal-cost tiles or nodes in spatial data trees to sync when under limited connectivity.  
- **Disaster Recovery Routing:** In edge cases where infrastructure is compromised (e.g., cables damaged), MSTs help rapidly re-establish minimal yet functional connectivity.  
- **Android Nearby Sharing:** Efficient peer-to-peer connection graphs are established using MST for quick device discovery and file exchange.  
- **AI Pipeline Cost Reduction:** Connects processing units over Google’s TPU clusters for model parallelism using lowest-cost links.
