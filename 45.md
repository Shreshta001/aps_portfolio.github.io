# 💧 **Reservoir Sampling for Real-Time Data Stream Analytics**

**Reservoir Sampling** is a randomized algorithm that allows for uniform sampling of `k` elements from a stream of unknown or massive size — **without storing the entire stream**. This makes it extremely valuable in large-scale systems like Google where data flows in real time and storage or multiple passes are infeasible.

## ⚙️ Algorithmic Highlights

| Metric             | Value                | Explanation                                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | O(n) for n items     | Processes each item once with constant time decision         |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | O(k)                 | Only stores k samples, regardless of stream size             |

### Step-by-step overview (for `k = 1`):
1. Initialize result with the first item.  
2. For each item `i` (i > 1):  
   - With probability `1/i`, replace the result with item `i`.  
3. The final result is a uniformly random item from the stream.

## 🧠 Fun Fact & Out-of-the-Box Google Applications

- **Sensor Networks (Nest Thermostats):** Google’s home automation devices use reservoir sampling to collect periodic temperature/power readings for trends without storing all readings.
- **Pixel Camera ML Training:** Pixel devices sample photos during normal use to improve auto-focus and exposure algorithms using real-world data.
- **Realtime Trend Animation:** Google Doodles and Earth Timelapse use sampled global interaction logs to animate data engagement during events like World Cup or Earth Day.
- **AI Code Suggestions in Colab & Android Studio:** Trained on streaming code snippets using reservoir sampling to avoid model bias from repetitive structures.
- **Live Transcription Quality Feedback:** Uniformly samples portions of live captions from Meet and Android Live Transcribe for model evaluation and improvements.
