# 🔍 Improving Search Suggestions with Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## 📌 Overview

Search engines thrive on giving users fast, relevant suggestions. The **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** algorithm helps by measuring the similarity between the user’s input string and popular search queries, identifying common subsequences that may indicate user intent.

## 🧠 Application

Google’s autocomplete features use LCS to find the longest common subsequence between a user's partial input and candidate queries in the database, thereby ranking and suggesting the most relevant completions.

| Metric             | Value           | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(m × n)`        | `m`, `n` = lengths of the two input strings                             |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(m × n)`        | Stores a dynamic programming matrix to compute subsequences             |
