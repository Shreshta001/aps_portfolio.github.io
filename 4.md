# 🔍 Improving Search Suggestions with Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

## 📌 Overview

Modern search engines thrive on delivering quick and accurate suggestions. One key technique behind this magic is the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** algorithm. It helps compare a user’s input with a list of known queries by identifying the longest matching character sequences — even if the characters aren’t next to each other. This reveals what the user *probably* meant to type.

By analyzing these subsequences, search systems can rank and suggest the most relevant completions in real-time — making the user's experience smoother and faster.

## 🧠 Application

Google’s autocomplete and suggestion systems use LCS under the hood to match a user’s partial query with massive datasets of past searches. The longer the common subsequence between the user input and a candidate phrase, the higher it ranks in suggestions.

| Metric             | Value        | Description                                                         |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(m × n)`   | `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings being compared       |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(m × n)`   | Builds a DP table to store subsequence results for each comparison  |

## 📊 Visual Representation

Imagine comparing the user’s input to a popular query. A dynamic programming matrix slowly fills up — highlighting the longest common subsequence found.
