# 📈 **Efficient Mean, Median, Mode Computations for Real-time Analytics**

## 📌 Overview

In the fast-paced world of real-time analytics, especially at the scale of platforms like **Google**, descriptive statistics such as **mean**, **median**, and **mode** play a crucial role in understanding live user behavior, system health, and content performance.

Unlike batch-processing, where data is analyzed after collection, real-time systems must compute these values **on-the-fly** as new data flows in — all while maintaining **speed, accuracy, and low latency**.

## 🧠 Application

Google's backend analytics engines use efficient data structures and **incremental algorithms** to handle statistics on massive live streams. Here's how each metric is computed effectively:

- 🧮 **Mean**: Updated in constant time using a running total and count.
- 🔢 **Median**: Managed using two heaps — a max-heap for the lower half and min-heap for the upper half — to find the middle value in `O(log n)` time.
- 📊 **Mode**: Maintained using a hashmap that tracks frequency counts in expected `O(1)` time for each new value.

These are essential for:
- 🚨 **Anomaly Detection**: Spotting spikes or dips in traffic, errors, or usage patterns.
- 👤 **User Behavior Insights**: Analyzing how long users stay, what they interact with, and what’s trending.
- 📉 **System Monitoring**: Tracking metrics like CPU load, request response times, and error rates.

| Metric             | Time Complexity     | Space Complexity | Description                                                   |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Mean             | `O(1)` per update    | `O(1)`           | Simple incremental average update                             |
| ⏳ Median           | `O(log n)`           | `O(n)`           | Two heaps for lower/upper halves                              |
| ⏳ Mode             | `O(1)` (avg)         | `O(n)`           | Hashmap for frequency tracking                                |
