# 🌐 **Google Meet Load Balancing with Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

Google Meet powers millions of video calls daily — from personal catchups to boardroom meetings. Behind the scenes, every video stream has to **travel the globe** smoothly, without buffering or lag.

To make that possible, Google uses **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** — a powerful algorithm that finds the **least-cost path** across its vast network. Think of it as choosing the best route based not just on distance, but on **latency, congestion, and server load**.

## 📡 Network as a Weighted Graph

- **Nodes:**  
  Google Meet edge servers, regional data centers, relay hubs

- **Edges:**  
  Network links with dynamic weights — including:
  - Latency  
  - Packet loss probability  
  - Load-based penalties (e.g., CPU/memory pressure)

- **Cost Function:**  
  > `Cost = Latency + Load Penalty`  
  A path with slightly more distance but **less traffic** may be cheaper!

## 🎯 Objective

To **deliver ultra-low-latency video and audio** by dynamically routing user sessions through the **most optimal network path**, even under surges like:

- Global conferences  
- School classes  
- Online exams or events

The system needs to balance between:
- Speed  
- Stability  
- Server health

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

Google applies **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, which guarantees the **least-cost solution** in graphs with non-negative weights.

| Metric             | Value             | Description                                    |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(E + V log V)`  | With priority queue (min-heap)                |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(V)`            | Stores cost-so-far for each visited node      |

## 🔮 Out-of-the-Box Use Cases Inside Google

### 1. **🧠 TPU Task Sharding in AI Models**

Use UCS to assign AI model shards (e.g., in BERT or Gemini) across TPU clusters. Cost = data transfer latency + cluster load.

> Ensures that **training is faster** without overwhelming compute zones.

---

### 2. **🌍 Google Maps EV Routing**

For electric vehicles, UCS could help route through **optimal charging stations**, minimizing time & traffic + battery stress.

> `Cost = distance + charger wait time + elevation penalty`

---

### 3. **📤 Google Drive Sync Optimization**

Optimize sync path for large files across multi-region cloud storage. UCS finds **cheapest replication route** considering bandwidth & region load.

> For example, sync India → US → EU might be cheaper than direct India → EU at peak hours.

---

### 4. **🔎 Google Search Microservice Calls**

Internally, Google Search spans **hundreds of microservices**. UCS can help minimize **inter-service latency** when assembling search results by optimizing call chains.

> Result: Faster snippet rendering with same resource use.

---

### 5. **🎮 YouTube Rewind or Shorts Path Stitching**

Create a video summary from top moments by selecting video paths (clips) with **minimum transition cost** (latency + relevance loss) — UCS as a creative stitcher.
