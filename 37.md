# 🌐 Google Meet Load Balancing with Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

Google Meet handles millions of live video calls. Ensuring smooth, low-latency routing is critical. UCS helps by finding **least-cost paths** through the network — balancing **latency** and **server load**.

## 📡 Network Representation

- **Nodes:** Google Meet edge servers and regional data hubs  
- **Edges:** Network paths with latency, packet loss, congestion  
- **Cost Function:** Total path cost = latency + load penalty

---

## 🎯 Objective

To route real-time video/audio across Google’s infrastructure **with minimum latency and load balance**, ensuring seamless communication even under global demand.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  
  Finds **optimal path** with least cost in weighted graphs.

| Metric             | Value             | Description                       |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(E + V log V)`  | With binary heap (priority queue) |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(V)`            | Stores node costs and visited set |
