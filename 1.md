# 🎯 **Optimizing Google Ads Allocation with the Assignment Problem**

Google Ads is the **backbone of Google's revenue model**, enabling advertisers to bid for ad placements across Google services — like **Search**, **YouTube**, and **partner sites**.

Efficiently assigning ads to available slots is a high-impact optimization problem. The objective is to **maximize:**

- 💵 **Expected revenue**
- ✅ **User engagement**

This challenge maps to the classical **Assignment Problem**, represented as a **bipartite graph**:

---

## 🎯 Bipartite Graph Representation

- **Left (Ads):**  
  Advertisers with:
  - Bid amounts  
  - Relevance scores  
  - Targeting info (keywords, demographics, etc.)

- **Right (Slots):**  
  Display locations based on:
  - User context (e.g., search query)  
  - Device type (mobile, desktop)  
  - Placement priority

- **Edges (Connections):**  
  Represents potential assignment of an ad to a slot.

  **Edge Weight Formula:**
  >Edge Weight = CTR* Bid


Where:
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** Predicted probability of a user clicking the ad  
- **Bid:** Amount advertiser is willing to pay per click  

➡️ Together, this gives the **expected revenue per impression**

---

## 🧠 Final Objective

Select ad-slot pairings that **maximize total expected revenue** while preserving user experience — at **Google scale**, this must happen **in real time**, billions of times per day.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

Google uses the **Hungarian Algorithm (Munkres Algorithm)** to compute the optimal ad-slot assignment.

### ✅ Benefits

- Maximizes total expected revenue or engagement  
- Respects fairness, relevance, and policy constraints  
- Scales to real-time demands using heuristics and parallelism  

| Metric             | Value       | Description                                             |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n³)`     | `n` = number of ads (or slots); assumes a square matrix |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n²)`     | Stores the cost matrix and matching information         |
