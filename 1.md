# 🎯 **Optimizing Google Ads Allocation with the Assignment Problem**

## 📌 Overview

Google Ads is the backbone of Google's revenue model, enabling advertisers to bid for ad placements across Google services — like Search, YouTube, and partner sites.

Efficiently assigning ads to slots requires maximizing **expected revenue** and **user engagement**. This problem maps to the classical **Assignment Problem**, modeled as a **bipartite graph**:

- **Left (Ads):** Advertisers with bids, relevance scores, targeting info  
- **Right (Slots):** Display locations with context (e.g., user query, device)  
- **Edge Weights:** `CTR × Bid` = **Expected revenue per impression**

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

Google uses the **Hungarian Algorithm (Munkres Algorithm)** to compute the optimal ad-slot assignment.

### ✅ Benefits

- Maximizes total expected revenue or engagement  
- Respects fairness, relevance, and policy constraints  
- Scales to real-time demands using heuristics and parallelism  

| Metric             | Value       | Description                                             |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n³)`     | `n` = number of ads (or slots); assumes a square matrix |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n²)`     | Stores the cost matrix and matching information         |

- **Edges:** CTR × Bid  
- **Goal:** Maximize sum of selected edges
