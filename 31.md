# 📅 **Managing YouTube Ad Placements with Interval Scheduling Problem**

YouTube earns revenue by displaying **mid-roll ads** during video playback. However, too many ads placed too close together may frustrate viewers. To balance revenue and user experience, YouTube models ad slot management using the **Interval Scheduling Problem**.

This problem helps YouTube choose the **maximum number of non-overlapping ad slots** within a given video timeline.

---

## 🎯 Interval-Based Ad Scheduling

- **Ad Slots (Intervals):**  
  Each ad is defined by:
  - ⏰ A start and end timestamp  
  - 💵 An estimated revenue score  
  - 📈 A relevance or targeting priority

- **Constraints:**  
  - No two ads should overlap  
  - Maintain viewer engagement and attention span

- **Goal:**  
  Schedule the **largest subset of ads** that don’t interfere with each other to **maximize ad revenue** and maintain a smooth viewing experience.

---

## 🧠 Final Objective

Use a **greedy scheduling algorithm** that prioritizes ad intervals finishing earliest. This ensures **maximum number of non-overlapping ads** are selected — keeping the platform profitable while ensuring viewer satisfaction.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

The classic **Greedy Interval Scheduling Algorithm** is used here. Sort all ad slots by end time, and **iteratively choose the earliest finishing non-conflicting interval**.

### ✅ Benefits

- Optimizes the number of ads shown  
- Avoids clustered or overlapping ads  
- Enhances user retention during ad breaks  

| Metric             | Value        | Description                                               |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n log n)`  | For sorting intervals by end time                        |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`        | To store the scheduled ads and metadata                  |
