# 🗃️ **Sparse Tables for Immutable Range Queries in Google’s Big Data Systems**

Sparse Tables are a powerful data structure designed for **fast, immutable range queries** (like range minimum/maximum queries) with **O(1) query time** after O(N log N) preprocessing. Though classic in competitive programming, their application at scale for massive, read-heavy datasets is game-changing, especially for Google’s analytics, search indexing, and monitoring systems where immutable data snapshots are common.

## ⚙️ Algorithmic Highlights

| Metric            | Value                         | Explanation                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Preprocessing   | O(N log N)                   | Build the sparse table from the input array |
| 🧠 Query Time      | O(1)                         | Constant-time queries for range minimum/maximum |
| 💡 Space Complexity| O(N log N)                   | Store precomputed answers for intervals of power-of-two lengths |

### Step-by-step overview:
1. Precompute answers for intervals of length 1, 2, 4, 8, ... (powers of two).  
2. Store these in a 2D table indexed by start and interval length.  
3. To answer a query [L, R], break it into two overlapping intervals of power-of-two length covering [L, R].  
4. Use precomputed results to retrieve the answer in O(1).
