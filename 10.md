# 🚀 Minimizing Cost in Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS)

## 📌 Overview

In data compression and genome sequencing, constructing a sequence that contains two input sequences as subsequences with minimum length is vital. The **Shortest Common Supersequence** problem finds this sequence, balancing cost and data completeness.

## 🧠 Application

Google applies SCS in DNA alignment, text merge, and autocomplete suggestions where minimal combined sequences enhance efficiency and relevance.

| Metric             | Value          | Description                                             |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(m × n)`     | *m* and *n* are the lengths of the two input sequences  |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(m × n)`     | DP table storing intermediate supersequence lengths     |
