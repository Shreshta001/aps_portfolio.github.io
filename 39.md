# 🎰 **Google Ads Reinforcement Learning with Urn Models**

Google Ads thrives on predicting what users will **click, skip, or engage with**. But before unleashing full-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL), Google often needs a **safe testbed** to simulate user behavior.

That’s where **Urn Models** come in — a powerful statistical tool to mimic user interactions **before real deployment**. Think of it as a probabilistic “sandbox” where ad strategies can **learn faster and safer**.

---

## 🧮 Urn Simulation Model

Urn models allow Google to simulate how users might react to ads — without actual user exposure.

- **Urn:** A bucket of possibilities (user behavior profiles)  
- **Balls:** Outcomes like clicks, skips, conversions, likes  
- **Draws:** Simulated user actions, used to **update belief** over time  
- **Replacement Logic:** Controls exploration vs exploitation



---

## 🎯 Objective

To **bootstrap and evaluate ad strategies** through controlled simulations, enabling:

- Faster RL policy convergence  
- Lower risk during ad cold starts  
- Fairness evaluation across demographic slices

## ⚙️ Approach Used

Google can use **Pólya Urns**, **Bayesian Urns**, or hybrid models that adjust probabilities based on past outcomes.

| Metric               | Value          | Description                                      |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🎲 Simulation Speed  | Instantaneous  | Enables mass testing of ad hypotheses            |
| 📊 Variance Control  | Tunable        | Balance novelty vs. precision in predictions     |
| 🧠 Learning Strategy  | Dynamic        | Bayesian updates model real-world RL shifts      |

## 🧠 Google Use Cases

| Application                | Benefit                                                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📈 **Ad Cold Start**        | Simulate early clicks to reduce ramp-up time                   |
| 🎯 **Creative Testing**     | A/B test new ad formats safely before live deployment          |
| ⚖️ **Fairness Evaluation**  | Audit how ads behave across gender, region, or device types     |
| 📊 **CTR Estimation**       | Calibrate probabilistic click-through estimates pre-training   |

## 🔮 Creative Out-of-the-Box Uses at Google

### 1. **🧠 RL Pre-training for YouTube Recommendations**

Use urn-based simulated viewers to **pre-train recommendation models** before deploying them to real users.  
> Model “watch” vs “drop” using replacement rules to capture user patience and interest shifts.

---

### 2. **🎮 Gamified UX Testing (e.g., Google Play Ads)**

Simulate in-app user behavior (e.g., ad skips vs reward claims) using urns to test UI strategies for higher engagement.

---

### 3. **🧪 Safe Policy Transfer Across Regions**

Train in one region using simulated draws, then test how the **ad policy might behave in a new country** — without real user exposure first.

---

### 4. **🧭 Ads Exploration under Regulation**

Use urns to safely simulate ad diversity outcomes — ensuring compliance with legal fairness norms **before live launch**.
