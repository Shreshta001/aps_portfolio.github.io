# 🎰 Google Ads Reinforcement Learning with Urn Models

Before deploying full-scale RL ad algorithms, Google simulates **user interaction** using probability-based urn models. This gives a fair and statistically stable initial estimate for ad effectiveness.

---

## 🧮 Urn Simulation Model

- **Urn:** Represents pool of possible user behaviors  
- **Balls:** Clicks, skips, likes — different outcomes  
- **Draw:** Simulates interaction; used to update probability distribution

---

## 🎯 Objective

To simulate user behavior fairly and efficiently — helping ads learn **faster, safer**, and with less bias.

## ⚙️ Approach

- **Pólya Urn / Bayesian Urn**  
- Probabilities update dynamically based on simulated outcomes

| Metric               | Value          | Description                        |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| 🎲 Simulation Speed  | Instantaneous  | Great for fast A/B simulation      |
| 📊 Variance Control  | Tunable        | Explore fairness, novelty vs CTR   |
