# 🏞️ **Optimal Cost Pathfinding Using Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a **best-first search algorithm** used when the goal is to **minimize cumulative cost** in a graph — without relying on heuristics. At Google, UCS supports routing, logistics, and backend infrastructure decisions where **every move has a cost**, and accuracy matters more than speed.

## 🗺️ Graph Representation

- **Nodes:**  
  Locations, routers, states, or waypoints.

- **Edges:**  
  Transitions with associated positive costs (e.g., distance, time, energy).

- **Cost Function:**  
  > Expands the node with **lowest total cost so far (g(n))**

- **Priority Queue (Min-Heap):**  
  Maintains frontier nodes by ascending cost order.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To find the **lowest-cost path** in a weighted graph — especially where **costs are non-uniform**, and **no heuristic** is available or reliable.

UCS is often used in:
- Base routing before applying heuristics (A*)
- Cost-sensitive infrastructure optimization
- Logistics route planning

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

Uniform Cost Search is like **Dijkstra’s algorithm**, but typically used in **goal-directed search problems**.

### ✅ Benefits

- Guarantees **optimal path** (if costs are positive)  
- Forms the backbone for A*  
- Simpler to implement than heuristic-based algorithms  

| Metric             | Value                                                  | Description                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(b^(1 + ⌊C*/ε⌋))`                                     | C* = cost of optimal solution, ε = min edge cost    |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | High (due to large frontier and path tracking)         | Grows with branching and cost range                 |

## 💡 Creative Use Cases at Google

### 1. **Data Center Power Optimization**
UCS can help route workloads in a data center while **minimizing energy cost**, based on current load, heat zones, and server location.

---

### 2. **Search Indexing Cost Management**
Optimize which documents to crawl or refresh first in Google Search based on update cost and expected freshness score.

---

### 3. **Chromebook Update Server Routing**
Google can optimize software updates to Chromebooks using UCS to select **low-latency + low-bandwidth** routes in global CDN networks.
