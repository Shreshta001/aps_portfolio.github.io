# 🔄 **Generating Permutations with the Johnson–Trotter Algorithm**

The **Johnson–Trotter algorithm** is a fascinating method to generate all permutations of a sequence **with minimal changes** — by simply swapping adjacent elements. Unlike brute-force recursive methods, it mimics natural transitions and is perfect for real-time systems where every change matters.

## 🧠 What Makes It Unique?

This algorithm generates **each permutation from the previous one** by swapping just two elements. It’s designed for scenarios where transition costs between states must be minimal, which makes it incredibly useful in simulations, animations, optimization engines, and data augmentation pipelines.

> Total of `n!` permutations generated with only one adjacent swap at each step.

## 🔍 Algorithm Overview

- Each number in the permutation has a direction (left or right)
- Find the **largest mobile element** — one that can move in its direction and is larger than the neighbor
- Swap it in that direction
- **Reverse directions** of elements larger than the mobile one
- Repeat until no mobile elements remain

This guarantees **adjacent transitions** and **no duplicate permutations**, ensuring smooth cycling through the permutation space.
