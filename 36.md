# 🧠 Accelerating PageRank with DFS and Priority Heuristics

PageRank is foundational to Google Search — it ranks web pages based on link structures. But **crawling the entire web** is slow. Enter **DFS + Priority Heuristics**: a smarter, focused way to crawl important pages **first**.

Instead of a blind crawl, this technique **dives deep** along **high-value outbound links**, accelerating relevance discovery and reducing bandwidth waste.

## 🌐 Graph-Based Web Representation

- **Nodes:** Web pages  
- **Edges:** Hyperlinks with weights (trust, PageRank, authority)  
- **Heuristic:** Prioritize links with high authority, click-through, or historical value

---

## 🎯 Objective

To crawl and rank pages faster by focusing early effort on **valuable or influential links** in the graph — not wasting time on dead-ends.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Link Priority Heuristic**

| Metric             | Value        | Description                          |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(V + E)`   | Pruned via priority-based filtering |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(depth)`   | DFS is memory-efficient             |
