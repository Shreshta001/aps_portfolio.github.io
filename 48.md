# ⚡ **Look-up Tables (LUTs) for Ultra-Fast Inference in Google’s AI Systems**

Look-up Tables (LUTs) are classic data structures that map inputs to precomputed outputs, offering constant-time retrieval. While simple in concept, LUTs can be **ingeniously combined with modern AI and compression techniques** to speed up inference and reduce computational costs — a huge advantage for Google’s massive-scale AI models running in data centers and edge devices.
