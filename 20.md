# 💍 **Stable Marriage Problem: Perfect Matches Made Efficiently**

The Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) is a classic algorithmic framework used to create **stable, conflict-free pairings** between two equally sized sets — like matching candidates to jobs or users to resources. The goal? No two individuals should prefer each other over their current matches, ensuring **stability** in assignments.

Google leverages this concept and its variants in many critical systems where balanced, fair, and stable matching is crucial, including:

- 👔 **Job matching platforms (like Google Careers)**  
- 📈 **Ad auction systems balancing advertisers and placements**  
- ☁️ **Cloud resource allocation between workloads and servers**  
- 🎓 **Internship and project assignment matching**

## 💡 Understanding the Problem

Given two groups, each member ranks all members of the opposite group based on preference. The SMP ensures a matching where no pair would rather break their current match to be with each other — avoiding instability and dissatisfaction.

| Group A (e.g., candidates) | Preference List Example         | Group B (e.g., companies) | Preference List Example       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Alice                      | Company1 > Company2 > Company3 | Company1                 | Alice > Bob > Carol           |
| Bob                        | Company2 > Company1 > Company3 | Company2                 | Carol > Alice > Bob           |
| Carol                      | Company3 > Company1 > Company2 | Company3                 | Bob > Carol > Alice           |

## ⚙️ Algorithm Highlights: Gale-Shapley

The Gale-Shapley algorithm iteratively matches members:

- **Each unmatched candidate proposes to their top choice not yet rejected by.**  
- **Companies tentatively accept the best proposal so far but may reject later if a better candidate applies.**  
- **Process repeats until everyone is matched stably.**

| Metric             | Value       | Explanation                        |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | O(n²)       | Worst-case proposals and rejections |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | O(n²)       | Preference matrices storage         |

## 🌐 How Google Uses & Innovates with Stable Matching

| Application                  | How SMP Flavors Enhance Google Systems                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 👔 **Job Matching**           | Efficiently matches candidates with open roles considering mutual preferences and skills |
| 📢 **Ad Auctions**            | Balances advertiser bids with ad slots ensuring fair, stable allocation that maximizes revenue and user relevance |
| ☁️ **Cloud Resource Scheduling** | Allocates resources like CPUs, GPUs fairly across competing workloads without conflicts or starvation |
| 🎓 **Internship & Mentorship** | Matches interns and mentors based on preferences, availability, and project needs for smooth collaboration |
| 🚗 **Ride Sharing Algorithms**  | Matches riders and drivers considering preferences, routes, and timing for optimized pairing |
| 🛠️ **Team Formation in Projects** | Creates balanced teams based on skills and preferences, avoiding unstable group dynamics |
| 🏆 **Tournament Scheduling**   | Assigns match-ups or slots ensuring fairness and no incentive to deviate |
| 🤝 **User Matching in Social Apps** | Powers friend or dating app algorithms ensuring stable, mutually satisfactory connections |

With Google’s scale, these algorithms evolve to handle **multi-dimensional preferences, dynamic arrivals, and weighted priorities**, making the Stable Marriage framework a versatile and essential building block.
