# 🧮 **Square Root Decomposition for Efficient Time-Series Aggregation in Google Systems**

**Square Root Decomposition** is a classic technique that breaks down large data arrays into manageable blocks, allowing efficient **range queries** and **point updates**. Though simple, it provides a robust foundation for analyzing time-series data in near real-time — a feature Google systems heavily rely on.

## ⚙️ Algorithmic Highlights

| Metric             | Value                       | Explanation                                               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | O(√n) per query/update       | Achieved by block-level preprocessing                     |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | O(n)                         | Stores the original array and auxiliary block sums        |

### Step-by-step overview:
1. Divide the array into √n blocks.
2. Precompute the sum (or relevant stat) of each block.
3. For a range query:
   - Sum full blocks directly.
   - Handle leftover elements at boundaries individually.
4. For updates:
   - Modify the original element.
   - Recalculate the block sum containing that element.
