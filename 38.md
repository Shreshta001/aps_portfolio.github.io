# 🧬 **Bioinformatics Search on Google Cloud using KMP Algorithm**

In genomics, time matters. Whether you’re searching for mutations, tracing viral variants, or powering personalized medicine — you’re navigating **billions of DNA characters**.

Enter **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** — a lightning-fast pattern-matching algorithm. When combined with the **scale of Google Cloud**, it empowers researchers to search DNA like Google searches the web.

## 🧬 DNA as Text

DNA is a sequence — and so is text.

- **Text:** Entire genome (`A`, `T`, `G`, `C`) stored in BigQuery or Google Cloud Storage  
- **Pattern:** A gene, mutation signature, or functional motif  
- **KMP Preprocessing:** Builds a prefix table to skip redundant comparisons

> KMP is like CTRL+F on petabytes of genetic data — but with no lag.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To **detect gene sequences quickly** across massive genomic datasets — unlocking faster:

- Mutation tracking  
- Drug response mapping  
- Variant classification  
- Ancestry & bioinformatics research

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

The **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)** algorithm offers linear-time pattern matching with low memory.

| Metric             | Value       | Description                              |
|--------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n + m)`  | `n` = genome size, `m` = pattern length  |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(m)`      | Stores only prefix table (partial match) |

## 🔮 Creative Out-of-the-Box Use Cases

### 1. **🧠 Real-Time Virus Variant Detection**

During outbreaks (e.g., COVID-19), labs upload sequences in real-time. KMP can run in Cloud Functions or BigQuery UDFs to:

> Detect spike protein mutations, new strains, or match known variant signatures.

---

### 2. **📦 DNA-as-a-Search-Index (Search Engine for Genomics)**

Imagine DNA stored like web documents — KMP becomes the **backend engine** to find gene “keywords.”  
Google Cloud could even expose it as a **bio-search API**.

---

### 3. **⚡ Lightning-Fast DNA Upload Validation**

When researchers upload new sequences, KMP can **validate format, check for contamination, or detect duplicates** — all in milliseconds.

---

### 4. **🎞️ Genome Animation Trimming**

In educational tools or genome browsers, use KMP to **highlight or animate regions** of interest like BRCA1, APOE, etc.  
> Skip unimportant frames, like a YouTube smart preview — but for DNA.

---

### 5. **🧬 CRISPR Off-Target Analysis**

When designing CRISPR edits, KMP can scan off-target regions in the genome to flag **unwanted matches**, reducing genetic side effects.
