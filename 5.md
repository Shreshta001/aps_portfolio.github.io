# ✍️ Auto-Correct Feature Enhancement with Longest Common Substring

## 📌 Overview

Google's auto-correct function improves typing accuracy by detecting the longest common substring between potentially misspelled words and dictionary entries, thus suggesting the closest valid words.

---

## 🧠 Application

By finding the longest continuous matching sequence of characters (substring) between user input and dictionary words, Google can prioritize corrections that require minimal editing, enhancing typing efficiency and reducing errors.

| Metric             | Value           | Description                                                             |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(m × n)`        | `m`, `n` = lengths of the two input strings                             |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(m × n)`        | Stores intermediate results using dynamic programming                   |
