# 🔐 **Strengthening Cryptographic Systems with the Coin Change Problem**

## 📌 Overview

Google’s security systems sometimes use cryptographic algorithms that rely on optimal partitioning of values, similar to the coin change problem, for efficient encoding and decoding.

## 🧠 Application

This problem helps determine the minimum number of coins (units) required to make change for a certain amount, analogous to minimizing operations in cryptographic protocols.

| Metric             | Value          | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n × m)`     | `n` = amount, `m` = number of coin denominations         |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`         | Stores DP arrays with minimum coins needed for amounts   |
