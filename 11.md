# 🎲 **Predicting Outcomes Using Urn Models**

## 📌 Overview

In the realm of probability and statistical modeling, **Urn Models** serve as a foundational concept to simulate randomness and uncertainty. Think of an urn filled with colored balls — each color representing a different outcome. Drawing a ball simulates an event, making these models a perfect fit for systems that rely on random sampling.

Tech giants like **Google** leverage these models in various applications — from A/B testing experiments to estimating the probability of a user clicking on a search result, and even simulating complex decision trees behind product interactions.

## 🧠 Application

Urn models allow us to model uncertainty and predict outcomes where events happen with known (or assumed) probabilities. Here’s how Google might use them:

- 🔍 **Click Prediction**: Estimate how likely a user is to click on an ad or search result by simulating interaction probabilities.
- ⚖️ **Load Balancing**: Randomly assign incoming requests to different servers with certain probabilities to avoid congestion.
- 🧪 **A/B Testing**: Randomly assign users to different feature sets or UI layouts and track responses.
- 🧠 **Decision Modeling**: Simulate user behavior under different product decisions using probabilistic outcomes.

| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(k)`               | `k` = number of outcome types or distinct balls                          |

## 📊 Visual Representation

Imagine an urn with red, blue, and green balls — each color corresponding to a different user action or system outcome. The number of balls of each color controls the probability of that outcome. Repeated random draws simulate user interaction and system behavior.
