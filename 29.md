# 💾 **Efficient Google Drive Storage Management Using 0/1 Knapsack Problem**

Google Drive provides users with limited storage space. When users try to back up or sync a subset of files, **choosing the most valuable ones** within the quota becomes crucial.

This challenge maps beautifully to the classic **0/1 Knapsack Problem** — where each file has a "value" (importance) and a "weight" (size), and we aim to **maximize value without exceeding the capacity**.

---

## 🎯 Knapsack Representation

- **Items (Files):**  
  Each file has:
  - 📂 A **size** (weight)
  - ⭐ An **importance score** (value)
  - ⏳ A timestamp or recent activity (optional heuristic)

- **Knapsack (Quota Limit):**  
  The user's available Drive storage in MB/GB.

- **Goal:**  
  Select files such that:
  - Total size ≤ available storage  
  - Total importance is **maximized**

---

## 🧠 Final Objective

To **recommend an optimal set of files** to back up or sync, ensuring the user makes the most of their available quota while preserving critical or frequently used content.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

This is solved using **Dynamic Programming** for the 0/1 Knapsack problem. In the Google ecosystem, it is **adapted with heuristics** for additional priorities like recent edits, sharing status, or file type.

###  Benefits

- Maximizes file relevance within space constraints  
- Optimizes sync performance  
- Adapts to user behavior dynamically  

| Metric             | Value         | Description                                            |
|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n * W)`     | `n` = number of files, `W` = total storage capacity     |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n * W)`     | Can be optimized using 1D DP or memoization           |
