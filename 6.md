# 🎒 **Optimizing Resource Allocation with the Knapsack Problem**

## 📌 Overview

In today's cloud computing environments like **Google Cloud**, efficiently managing and allocating computational resources—such as CPU time, memory, and network bandwidth—is critical. These resources are finite, yet the number of client tasks or services competing for them is constantly growing.

To tackle this challenge, we explored how the **Knapsack Problem**, a classic algorithmic strategy, can be adapted to help Google Cloud (or similar platforms) optimize resource scheduling. The goal is to ensure **maximum performance and customer satisfaction** within defined constraints.

## 🧠 Application of Knapsack in Cloud Resource Allocation

The **0/1 Knapsack Problem** provides a powerful model for real-world decision-making, where:

- Each **task** has a **profit/value** (e.g., priority, revenue, SLA importance)
- Each task consumes a specific **amount of resources** (e.g., CPU hours, memory)
- The system has a **fixed capacity** of available resources

Using **dynamic programming (DP)**, we determine the optimal subset of tasks that:
- Fit within the total resource budget
- Provide the highest cumulative benefit

| Metric             | Value            | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n × W)`        | `n` = number of tasks, `W` = total resource capacity              |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n × W)`        | DP table stores combinations of included/excluded tasks          |

## 🧑‍💻 Code Reference

We created a reference implementation for the Knapsack approach that simulates resource scheduling in Python. You can find it here:

👉 [Knapsack Problem Implementation](https://github.com/Shreshta001/aps_portfolio.github.io/blob/main/codes/6.cpp).

The implementation accepts:
- A list of tasks with their resource cost and benefit
- A total available resource limit
- Outputs the most efficient task selection strategy

## 🌐 Real-World Relevance in Google Cloud

| Feature                  | Impact                                                             |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ Resource Scheduling     | Dynamically assigns computing power to the most beneficial tasks   |
| 🧮 Load Balancing          | Prevents bottlenecks by evenly distributing load across resources |
| 💻 Task Selection          | Filters and prioritizes tasks based on available resources        |
| 🌱 Efficiency              | Maximizes throughput and minimizes waste                          |

This mirrors the way services like **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** or **Google Cloud Scheduler** allocate limited system capacity under real-time pressure.
