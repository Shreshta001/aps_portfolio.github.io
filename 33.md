# 🚦 **Optimizing Flow in Networks with Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**

At the heart of many of Google's network routing and resource management tasks lies the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** — a powerful method to compute the **maximum flow** in a network. This algorithm is used when Google needs to **dynamically allocate bandwidth**, optimize routing, or solve matching problems in its massive infrastructure.

## 🌐 Flow Network Representation

- **Nodes (Vertices):**  
  Represent sources (e.g., entry points), sinks (e.g., destinations), and intermediate routers or services.

- **Edges (Links):**  
  Carry a flow with:
  - A **capacity** (e.g., max bandwidth)  
  - A **current flow** (starts at 0, grows with augmenting paths)

- **Source to Sink:**  
  The goal is to send the **maximum flow** from the source node to the sink node without violating capacities.

---

## 🧠 Final Objective

The Ford-Fulkerson method finds **augmenting paths** in the network — paths where additional flow can be pushed — and keeps doing this **until no such path exists**.

The result is the **maximum total flow** from source to sink.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

- Uses **DFS or BFS** to find augmenting paths in the **residual graph**  
- Repeats flow augmentation until no more valid paths  
- Simple but very effective in practice, especially when capacities are integers

### ✅ Benefits

- Helps in **network bandwidth allocation**, **distributed system planning**, and **cloud resource balancing**  
- Provides a foundation for other advanced flow-based algorithms like **Edmonds-Karp** and **Dinic’s Algorithm**  

| Metric             | Value               | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(E * max_flow)`    | `E` = edges, depends on flow value          |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(V + E)`           | Efficient in space, stores graph structure  |
