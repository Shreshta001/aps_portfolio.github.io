# ⏱️ **Optimizing YouTube Video Recommendations Using Activity Selection Problem**

YouTube's "Watch Next" recommendations aim to maximize user engagement by suggesting **a sequence of videos** that don’t feel repetitive, fit within the user's time, and keep them interested.

This mirrors the **Activity Selection Problem**, where the goal is to **select the largest number of non-overlapping activities** — or in this case, videos — that a user is most likely to watch consecutively.

---

## 🎯 Activity-Based Video Recommendation

- **Videos (Activities):**  
  Each video has:
  - An estimated watch time (start–end interval)
  - A theme or topic
  - An engagement score or relevance

- **Constraints:**  
  - Avoid thematic or time-overlap  
  - Fit within the user's likely session length  

- **Goal:**  
  Recommend a set of videos:
  - That don’t "compete" with each other  
  - That maximize **engagement** and **completion rate**

---

## 🧠 Final Objective

Design a **greedy selection algorithm** to choose a non-overlapping, diverse playlist that aligns with user intent and platform goals like **session duration**, **content discovery**, and **viewer satisfaction**.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

The classic **Greedy Approach** to the Activity Selection Problem is used. Sort videos by end time (or score), and **iteratively pick the next video** that doesn’t overlap with the last selected one.

### ✅ Benefits

- Ensures high diversity in recommendations  
- Matches user attention span with video length  
- Efficient and scalable for real-time feed ranking  

| Metric             | Value         | Description                                                |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n log n)`   | For sorting by end time or score                          |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`         | To store selected video set and metadata                  |
