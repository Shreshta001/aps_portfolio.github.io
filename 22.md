# 🧮 **Kadane’s Algorithm: Real-Time Insights from Streaming Data** 

**Kadane’s Algorithm** is a dynamic programming technique to find the **maximum sum of a contiguous subarray** in linear time. It’s widely used in **signal processing**, **anomaly detection**, and **trend analysis** — and forms a crucial building block in high-scale systems like those at **Google**.

---

## 💡 What Problem Does It Solve?

Given an array of integers (positive, negative, or both), Kadane’s algorithm identifies the subarray with the **largest possible sum** — efficiently, in just a single scan.

Instead of recalculating all possible subarrays (which is computationally expensive), Kadane’s tracks just two values:

- `current_max`: Max subarray sum ending at the current index  
- `global_max`: Max subarray sum found so far

This makes it lightning-fast and suitable for **real-time analytics**.

-Kadane’s Algorithm is like a **pattern detector for human behavior**. Whether it’s identifying when users are most engaged, or when something went wrong, it gives engineers and data scientists **a one-pass lens to interpret events** — fast.

-At Google scale, this matters. Billions of data points come in every second. Kadane-inspired techniques help quickly zoom in on **“something interesting just happened here”** — a drop in search quality, a spike in usage, or a moment where a video goes viral.
