# 📊 Enhancing Data Analysis with the Subset Sum Problem

## 📌 Overview

In today's data-driven world, especially at the scale of systems like **Google Analytics**, it's essential to efficiently identify specific subsets of data that meet a defined numerical condition. One such practical case involves finding **subsets that add up to a target value**, which can help in pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and precise data segmentation.

This challenge is modeled by the **Subset Sum Problem**, a classic algorithm in computer science. By leveraging it, we can empower large-scale analytics platforms to extract meaningful insights from vast amounts of raw data.

## 🧠 Application of Subset Sum in Data Analytics

The **Subset Sum Problem** seeks to determine whether there exists a subset of a given set whose sum is equal to a specific target. Beyond its theoretical appeal, it finds real applications in:

- Fraud detection (unusual combinations of transactions adding up to a known suspicious total)
- Report generation (grouping data entries to meet constraints)
- Budget distribution or quota-based resource planning

In Google Analytics-like systems, this enables dynamic queries such as:
> “Find all user behavior combinations that sum to a specific engagement metric.”

| Metric             | Value           | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n × sum)`    | `n` = number of elements, `sum` = target sum value              |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n × sum)`    | DP table used to track reachable sums for all subsets           |

## 🧑‍💻 Code Reference

A simple implementation of the Subset Sum Problem using dynamic programming has been created to simulate dataset filtering by sum constraints.

👉 [Subset Sum Problem Implementation](https://github.com/Shreshta001/aps_portfolio.github.io/blob/main/codes/7.cpp).

This code can be adapted to:
- Scan large user datasets
- Match input subsets to specified key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Segment and label meaningful data groups
