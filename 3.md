# 🔢 **Predicting User Behavior with Ways to Reach a Number**

## 📌 Overview

At Google’s scale, understanding how users move through a sequence of actions — like clicking links, watching videos, or completing searches — is crucial for improving user experience and refining product flows.

A powerful way to model this behavior is to ask:  
**How many different paths can a user take to reach a specific goal?**

This forms the core idea of the **Ways to Reach a Number** problem, which is conceptually similar to the **coin change problem** in computer science.

## 🧠 Application

Google leverages **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to analyze these user journeys.

Each "step size" represents a possible action a user might take (like visiting a new page or clicking a button).  
The goal is to count **how many distinct action sequences** can lead to a specific state — say, a successful search, a YouTube watch, or a checkout.

| Metric             | Value           | Description                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n × m)`       | `n` = target goal, `m` = possible action types (step sizes)           |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`           | Keeps track of ways to reach each intermediate step                   |
