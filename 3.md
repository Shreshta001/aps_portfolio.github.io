# 🔢 Predicting User Behavior with Ways to Reach a Number

## 📌 Overview

Understanding how users navigate through a sequence of actions (like clicks or page visits) helps Google optimize user experience and site architecture. Modeling the number of distinct paths to reach a particular "state" or goal action provides insight into user behavior and funnel effectiveness.

## 🧠 Application

This problem is conceptually similar to the **coin change problem** in algorithm design. Using **Dynamic Programming**, Google calculates the number of unique sequences (paths) by which a user can reach a target action, accounting for different "step sizes" or intermediate interactions.

| Metric             | Value           | Description                                                           |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n × m)`       | `n` = target action, `m` = number of possible step sizes              |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`           | Maintains DP table of counts to reach each intermediate state         |

## 📊 Visual Representation

Think of a step diagram where each step size represents a jump from one user action to the next, and the DP table accumulates ways to reach the goal.
