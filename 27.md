# 📈 **Modeling Conversion Funnels in Google Analytics using “Ways to Reach a Number”**

Google Analytics helps businesses track how users **move through various stages** of a website or app — from first visit to final conversion.  
To understand and optimize this flow, we can borrow a concept from dynamic programming: **Ways to Reach a Number**.

This models **every possible sequence** a user might take through the funnel, like counting the number of ways to climb stairs using 1, 2, or 3 steps.

---

## 🎯 Dynamic Flow Representation

- **Target (Conversion Goal):**  
  Final step in the funnel (e.g., "Purchase Completed")

- **Allowed Steps (User Actions):**  
  - Progress one step at a time (View → Add to Cart)  
  - Skip intermediate steps (directly to Checkout)  
  - Re-engage after bounce

- **Analogy:**  
  Each user journey is like a path to reach a number `n` using allowed step sizes `[1, 2, 3]`, where each combination = a valid conversion path.

---

## 🧠 Final Objective

Determine the total number of unique user paths that reach the **final conversion point**, while identifying the **most frequent patterns** and **bottlenecks**.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Used

This problem maps to the **Dynamic Programming** formulation of the “Ways to Reach a Number” problem.

### ✅ Benefits

- Captures **non-linear journeys** through funnels  
- Allows **real-time analysis** of user paths  
- Enables better **A/B testing** and **conversion prediction**

| Metric             | Value         | Description                                       |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(n * k)`     | `n` = total funnel steps; `k` = allowed transitions |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(n)`         | DP array storing intermediate results             |

- **Root:** Funnel Start (e.g., Landing Page)  
- **Leaf Nodes:** Funnel Goal (e.g., Purchase)  
- **Edges:** Allowed user transitions (clicks, skips, re-visits)
