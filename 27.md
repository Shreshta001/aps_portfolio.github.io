# 🎥 YouTube Transcript Similarity Using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

In the vast ocean of videos uploaded to YouTube every minute, how does Google ensure originality, detect duplicates, or identify subtle plagiarism? One elegant trick: **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**.

This classic string algorithm helps YouTube compare video transcripts—measuring how much content overlaps between them—even if some words are shuffled, edited, or paraphrased.

## 🌍 Real-World Application at Google

| Use Case                           | How LCS Algorithm Powers the System                                        |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔁 **Duplicate Content Detection**    | Flags videos with large overlapping transcript chunks                      |
| 🛡️ **Copyright Enforcement**         | Finds reuploaded or slightly modified versions of protected content        |
| 🧠 **Content Clustering & Discovery**| Groups videos with similar narratives for better recommendations           |
| 🧪 **AI Subtitle Verification**      | Cross-checks auto-generated captions with official ones for accuracy       |

## ✨ Why LCS?

LCS finds the **longest ordered sequence** of words that appear in both transcripts, ignoring insertions or edits. It's a subtle but powerful way to detect **semantic similarity without requiring exact matches**.

Let’s say we have:

- **Transcript A:**  
  “how to train your dog at home using positive reinforcement”
  
- **Transcript B:**  
  “training your puppy using positive reinforcement at home”

The LCS might be:
> `"training", "your", "using", "positive", "reinforcement", "at", "home"`

Same meaning, slightly different wording—but **LCS catches it.**

## ⚙️ Under the Hood

- LCS uses **Dynamic Programming** to build a table that compares every word in both transcripts.
- It tracks the longest matched subsequence in **order** (but not necessarily contiguous).

### 🚀 Performance

| Metric             | Value       | Explanation                                      |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ⏳ Time Complexity  | `O(m × n)`   | `m` and `n` are lengths of the two transcripts   |
| 🧠 Space Complexity | `O(min(m,n))`| Optimized using rolling arrays in practice       |

## 🎯 Unique Ways Google Leverages LCS

🧩 **1. Detecting Script Reuse Across Creators**  
Even if the video visuals differ, reused narration or scripts (e.g. tutorial formats) are detected to **prevent spam networks** or **click-farm duplicates**.

🎙️ **2. Comparing Human vs AI-generated Captions**  
Google compares the LCS of AI-generated subtitles and manually uploaded captions to **score model accuracy**, improving future auto-captioning.

🎬 **3. Trending Topic Grouping**  
LCS helps group transcripts by theme. If many videos share a core message ("AI in education", "budget travel hacks"), it helps surface trends **before they go viral**.

📡 **4. Legal Evidence in DMCA Claims**  
When creators file a copyright takedown, YouTube can run LCS checks on transcripts to offer **fast, scalable textual similarity evidence**.

## 🧠 Fun Facts

- YouTube combines **LCS + semantic embeddings**, meaning "dog" and "puppy" might be treated as a **soft match** in some systems.
- LCS is used not just on words, but **phoneme-level transcript sequences** to catch paraphrased speech patterns!
- LCS-style algorithms are also used in **Google Docs diffing**, when you compare document revisions.
